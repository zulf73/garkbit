# garkbit
A lightweight photo gallery manager for creating embeddable in-line galleries. Create a garkbit gallery and easily embed it into your website / blog.

garkbit uses [PhotoSwipe](http://photoswipe.com/) as a front-end responsive image gallery.

Built in React + Redux, with a Node.js / Express API layer and MongoDB database.

This is a hobby project and work in progress. It is not meant to be production-ready software.

v0.1 - feature complete for initial proof of concept.
